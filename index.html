				If you're looking for more than just a general education, we invite you to explore the fields of computer technology with the Association for Computing Machinery at Southeast Missouri State University. 
				Here you will be given opportunities to network with programmers, engineers, and computing enthusiasts while diversifying yourself by being engaged in extracurricular activities. 
				Our major focus covers concepts in Software Development, but we also enjoy mixing things up with some Cybersecurity and computer hardware. 
			</p>
			<p class="fillerText" style="padding-top:0;">
				Our members are proponents for innovation and enjoy experimenting, so never expect one meeting to be the same as the last. 
				We host a variety of events such as tech talks, skills-based workshops, social meetups, and community outreaches. 
				If you like professional meetings, we have those, and if you like laid back meetings, we got you there too. 
				We're all students who are working towards learning more in computer technology, while having some fun at it.
